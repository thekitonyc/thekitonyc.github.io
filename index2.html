    <h1>The Ki to NYC</h1>

    <p class="bio">
        Hi, I’m Ki! From the moment I could hold a pencil, I’ve been sketching my dreams of a life in New York City, surrounded by the energy and creativity that the fashion world has to offer. Fashion isn’t just a passion for me; it’s a way to tell stories, celebrate individuality, and spread joy through art. I believe that clothing has the power to transform how we see ourselves and the world around us.<br><br>
        Every time I see a beautiful outfit or a stunning runway show, my heart races with excitement and inspiration. I’ve poured my heart into honing my skills through classes, community workshops, and countless late-night projects. But to truly chase my dreams, I need to study in NYC, where the heartbeat of fashion thrives.<br><br>
        However, this journey comes with its challenges, and I can’t do it alone. I’m humbly reaching out for donations to help cover my tuition and living expenses while I embark on this incredible adventure. Your support, no matter how big or small, means the world to me and will bring me one step closer to my dreams.<br><br>
        Thank you for considering helping me turn my dreams into reality. Together, we can make a difference!
